        At some point during the (pleasant) summer of 2010, I realized I hadn't really been challenging myself musically for some time. In an effort to engage with more experimental, ambient, and avant-garde music, I spent a solid day scouring allmusic.com to put together a list of over 25 relevant albums, which I posted on my blog, "Tonight I Dine on Turtle Soup". This was when I was working at Gerstein Library and had plenty of downtime to fill out T.I.D.o.T.S. (because virtually no one read it, was a great outlet to log music discoveries and and explore half-baked ideas with relative privacy and minimal algorithmic manipulation). Posting that list, which included <em>Cold Summer<em>, turned out to be a consquential moment in the development of my listening and collecting habits, as it helped drive my interest in this kind of music. Anyways, it wasn't more than a week later that I spotted this unassuming cover in the new arrivals shelf at Vortex Records (R.I.P.) in Midtown Toronto. Sure enough, it was Cold Summer. An auspicious start.
        </p>
        <p>
          What can I saw about Lull expect that it's a dark ambient side project of former Napalm Death drummer and Birmingham techno producer Mick Harris. The album has a spacious, minimal presence, full of brooding drones and ethereal textures, that came to mind as an opener, 
          and its evocative title: qualities that speak to something vaguely ominous, but meditative, calm.

        <h3>
          From FREE-D ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK (FREE RECORDS, 1994)
        </h3>
        <p>
          I believe I learned about this band in 2003, from an Angelfire(?) website my older cousin made to list shoegaze and dreampop bands, which turned out to be an important reference for my musical discoveries at the time. I remember reading a glowing review of this album on allmusic.com but couln't find it on slsk, so decided I'd wait until I got a real copy to hear it. It took a couple years but I found it in Penguin Music (R.I.P.) in downtown Toronto. It was a surprise to see this not-terribly-common album in the record store I frequented almost every week, and finding it felt like I'd fulfilled fate. Listening to it was a little anti-climactic, but it increasingly grew on me. It may have helped that I fell asleep to it for a good while, which may have planted it into my subconcious (recently there was a period of a couple years where the glockenspiel section would suddenly become stuck in my head and I could never remember where it was from).
        </p>
        <p> 
          <em> Free-D Original Soundtrack<em> (a confusing title, as I don't believe there's any film by that name) mixes shoegaze, new age, and trancey chill-out in a guitar band format. Although it's similar to what bands like Seefeel and Bark Psychosis were doing, it has a very distinct sound. I have no idea what was happening musically in the Czech Republic in the years following the Velvet Revolution, or if The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa is representative of that, but in any case, it gave us this. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I'll just add that this track made it into the mix by chance. This is the only album I keep a digital copy of on my laptop, since my CD has a worrying case of disc rot (apparently common for this album). When it came time to make the mix, this track was already there, in the right place at the right time.

            Not much of a story here. I ordered this record online after reading about it on an ILX forum about DJ Sprinkles, who released a "Deeperama" re-work of this song, along with the original mix. I don't know much about Simon Fisher Turner, except that he's a prominent English composer who made this as part of his 2013 score for the 1924 documentary, <em>The Epic of Everest</em>. What a mighty wallop.

            I first heard this track as the opener on a Frankie Bones rave tape from the 90s that I came across online. There's something very impressive about that lo-fi recording of Frankie introducing the set, crowing to the crowd in his Brookyln accent, over the song's extended beatless intro. I don't think I found out what the track was until I heard it as the closer on Tako Reyenga's promo mix accompanying Music From Memory's first <em>Virtual Dreams</em> compilation. The track contains two particular sounds that are significant for me: The dreamy synth pads, which you can also hear on <em>Le Soleil Et La Mer</em> by Reload (1993), one of my longtime favourite songs (I wonder if it was a preset, or if there lending of gear), and the Sarangi sample. For years I wondered where the latter came from, until I saw a comment on discogs, posted by David Morley himself, noting that it was from an E-mu sound library CD. I'm still not sure if it's the same sound you hear at the end of <em>Tropical Bells</em> by The Olivia Tremor Control, or a trailer to the film <em>Fallen Angels</em> by Wong Kar-Wai that has apparently been memory-holed (I can now can only find versions without the sample).
          </p>
          <p>
            I ordered this record on discogs in late 2023, during a short stint living at my parents' house while my apartment was under renovation. Getting this record felt like giving myself a little treat during a very stressful time.

            I got this album on a balmy September 2005 weekend, just after the start of my last year of highschool. 20 years later, I can still remember what I was wearing that day (brown courduroy pants and a pink aNYthing t-shirt). I associate that memory with a warm feeling of starting something new while finishing something bigger and, at the same time, preparing to move onto something even bigger. I got the album at the original Sonic Boom on Bloor Street in Toronto, before it moved into the ground floor of Honest Ed's (R.I.P.), opened and closed a short-lived second location in Kensington Market, then moved a second time into its current Chinatown location, where it's now crowded by kids who were born after I got this album and are now the age I was then. Back in the original location, all the vinyl was relegated to the basement. Now, the CD to vinyl ratio is reversed. That was truly the golden age of buying CDs: everyone got iPods and started selling off their collections and labels were still pressing CDs like normal, so CDs were abundant and rarely picked over. This was an album I'd been looking out for, since I'd been aware of Two Lone Swordsmen since first getting into Warp Records, and have always been fascinated by Andrew Weatherall, all the more so since his death (not to ignore Keith Tenniswood, who is less of a historical figurehead, but also a great producer, as his solo productions as Radioactive Man show).   
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyways, this is a true beatless (semi-beatless?) banger, which gets very heavy without relying on the kick. The combination of the rude, boiseterous bass and the synth line, with its goofy tone and irrevent jazz styling is just wonderful.

            I got this record at Rotate This in fall 2023, during a lunch break when I temporarily worked at my employer's Queen and Ossington office. I got a used copy of this record that had some Berghain souvenirs (a shopping bag and flyer) tucked into the sleeve. Incidentally, the first time I went to Berghain, I bought a t-shirt that was stolen/lost a few days later, so I'd like to think I'm part of a cosmic cycle of Berghain swag passing hands. I also saw Barker DJ on a separate Berghain visit in 2014, which was far and ahead the best set of the day. Back then, he was pretty much just releasing music with nd_baumecker, and while I liked their co-productions, this was the first inkling of his unique and exciting work as a solo producer. This track is a lot more percussive than his other tracks but no less unique.

            I got <em>Trainer</em>, a two-CD compilation of Plaid's early, non-Black Dog Productions work, in April 2004 at Penguin Music. That was right before I went on a life changing high school art class trip to New York City, so I listened to it on the 11 hour bus ride there. I fondly recall going through the Holland tunnel, watching the reflection of headlights bounce the tiled walls while listening to swirling, filter-swept synths of <em>Yak</em>, a sensory combination that took on a vivid, trippy quality. After we arrived, I spent a while listening to <em>Reishi</em> on repeat in the hotel lobby, which is when something about the track clicked. The grand arc of the track, it's emotional crescendo, the weird but funky sounds and textures... there's nothing like it. <em>Trainer</em> took on a kind of talismanic quality for me after that, and I brought it on many significant travels, including my first trip to the UK, my first trip to East Asia, and others. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Reishi is by Tura, an alias of Andy Turner of Plaid. I think it might be my favourite track in the early Black Dog Productions / Plaid Universe, which for me puts it among the best music ever.

          </h3>

            I actually don't remember where I got this record, but I'm going to guess it was at Atom Heart in Montreal. I know it was in 2021, possibly during a trip to Montreal that summer (a mildly life-changing vacation, since it broke my 18-month long fever of pandemic dissociation and personal/professional crisis). Jump Source, the duo of Patrick Holland and Francis Latreille, also from Montreal, pin down exactly the kind of sound I was most into at the time. During the pandemic, I got a little obsessed with anything that called up 90s ambient techno or the more tasteful strands of early progressive house and trance - styles that were totally unfashionable when I was coming up in the mid-2000s but had, by 2020, been reborn in the trend cycle. During the bleakness and boredom of lockdown, my imagination expanded when it came to 90s music and design, especially if it used then-novel but now-dated technology to convey a sense of the futuristic. I also took to contemporary records that drew on that style, but remain tasteful and fresh by never falling into pastiche or blithe nostalgia. I would listen to these records, admire their graphics, and fantasize about what it was like to hear music like this in the mid-90s. I'd wonder what it was like to go to record stores or raves in a pre-internet era, when electronic music and digital design carried a novelty that pointed toward a future far cooler than the dystopian tech-bro blandness of the present. At one point, I even made up my own fictional record label from the 90s, designing fake singles with their own graphics and backstories. I realize this is exactly the kind of glib nostalgia I just dismissed, but for me it let me access a very distinct <em>feeling</em>, drawn from the depths of first hearing stuff like Orbital or Aphex Twin when I was like 10. Back then, that music seemed like something from another time and place, something closer to the virtual world of video games and arcades, or proto-vapourwave images of hyper-modern neon-lit East Asian megacities. It's a little embarassing, because so much of it is unabashased nostalgia, but it remains one of the most compelling feelings I experience, and has been an important creative driver for me and many others that do a much better job turning it into something that isn't a simulacra of 90s signifiers. In addition to Jump Source, that includes Latreille (a/k/a Priori), who may be my favourite producer of the 2020s, and the Montreal label NAFF, close kin to Latreille and Holland. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Jump Source aren't so overtly tied to this aesthetic, and have since moved onto other styles, including early-00s minimal (which I find much less alluring since I lived through it the first time). Still, this release stands out for me as exemplary of that "feeling". Even the name "Jump Source", whose significance eludes me, touches on something that makes a kind of perfect sense, affectively. This track in particular is one of my favourites for both the quality of production and richness of feeling.

            I got this one in April 2024 at Impressions Philadelphia on a trip to (you guessed it) Philadelphia. A few years earlier, I regrettably passed on a copy of another Merrick Brown record that had stuck with me, so was happy to find something else by him. I love how subtle but deep this track is, it's very lowkey but offers a lot if you pay attention to the keys and synths, which just kind of float along the heavy kicks.

            I'm very curious about Merrick Brown, a talented producer who also ran some labels with impressive-looking catalogues (including Tektite) but was only active from 1998-2003 (though more like 99-02). This was all in Austin, Texas, which I don't usually associate with quirky minimal house and techno (though he was evidently working with Texan electro stars Convextion and Maetrik). Seems like there might be an interesting story there.

It took me like 20 stressful minutes to pay for it, because I'd ran out of cash and, being Canadian, couldn't use Venmo. I'm glad I figured it out (I used Paypal) because it's a great record. I caught onto it because noticed it was on Straylight, the same label that put out a Seafoam record I'd recently got and cherished. I also learned Ilk is the brother of Seafoam (among two others, also producers, in the evidently musical Cavender family). I should note I was very into Seafoam at this moment, so this was all valuable information to discover, and not unlike Seafoam, Ilk makes tracks that are rich in depth and texture, with the right balance of heft and funk. This track, with its electro-tinged rhythms and hook gives it a unique quality that makes it stand out for me.

I became a big fan of the label after that, and would always notice Mosaic releases when looking through record bins.

            I got this record at the Ikekuburo Disk Union in Tokyo, on my second visit to Japan in December 2022. On my first visit in 2018, visiting this shop was the last thing I did before getting my luggage and going to the airport. The selection was particularly good that day, so I didn't end up with time to explore the area, which weighed on me until I returned. When I finally got to explore it, 4.5 years later, it wasn't anything special, and the stock at Disk Union wasn't anything special either (of course, the windfalls came at the places that weren't special the first time around). This record was a good find, though. Like with the neighbourhood of Ikekubro, I am sometimes haunted by the recollection of records I passed over at earlier, more ignorant points in life, including some used Red Planet records someone was selling on craigslist. For that reason - and because it's a fascinating label, with its whole design and concept, anonymity, and adjacency to Submerge in Detroit, plus good tracks - I tend to be curious about Red Planet releases, though perhaps less so since many were recently re-pressed (available supply dulls the lure of mystery). I don't know who produced this, or really who produced any Red Planet records (I think Jeff Mills and Mike Banks did some?), and couldn't (easily) find info on this.

            I assume the idea of "sex in zero gravity" is supposed to sound cool and freaky, but when you think about it, it seems awfully unsexy, awkward and impractical at best, if not impossible (a quick google search suggests this has  never reportedly happened and is biologically improbable).

            If, as I wrote about Jump Source, I spent the pandemic daydreaming about records that exemplify the more futuristic aesthetic of 90s dance music, I was just as infatuated with mid to late 90s tech house from the UK and North America. I was, again, drawn to an idea of pre-internet culture when functional but slightly eccentric house was at its peak, well before the tech-house implosion of the late-2000s/2010s. For me, these records symbolized a bygone social relation to music, when making records and DJing weren't so accelerated by the convenience of DAWs, CDJs, streaming platforms, and algorithms. How much of that is misplaced nostalgia? A lot. But still, this was during peak lockdown and my imagination latched onto these attractive anchors. This was also a time when late-90s early-00s UK tech house was newly in vogue, thanks to a widespread revival of this sound, largely driven by DJs like Gene on Earth, re-issue labels like Mint Condition and Above Board, and less benevolently, the discogs market boom for these records. For better or worse, it was the latter that turned me onto this record. I had recently discovered that Layo and Bushwacka didn't just make the terrible turn-of-the-millenium breaks I knew them for, but also genuinely exciting music, so I started connecting the dots on discogs, which led me to Bicycle Thieves. Bicycle Thieves are Layo Pashkin and Sandip Jethwa, 
            
            the only two singles officially released on the label Urban Decay. Right away, the then-futuristic now-dated cover art (check the <a href="https://i.discogs.com/7k6dSksyKfQdt4jPnIMFYWVMhh2pft0m0LfYovS-gdo/rs:fit/g:sm/q:90/h:600/w:589/czM6Ly9kaXNjb2dz/LWRhdGFiYXNlLWlt/YWdlcy9SLTgwMTcy/LTEyMzY1NDYyNDYu/anBlZw.jpeg" target="_blank")>B side</a>, with its 3D text and Death Star-like background) lit up my imagination. Given the rarity and relative status these two records earned in my mind, it was a surprise to see this one listed on Invisible City's discogs page, and it was in good condition, not cheap, but how many records conjure the tight wound mania of this track?

            I've been into Spacetime Continuum for 20 years, but until recently stuck to his album <em>Emit Ecaps</em> and some other bits and pieces before checking out his other work. What turned me onto Sea Biscuit was (like with David Morley's <em>Evolution</em>) Tako Reyenga's promo mix for <em>Virtual Dreams</em>, which features a different track from this album. Inspired me to track down source material from that mix, I got this CD on discogs this past year. This track is the standout for me, it's the ideal point between ambient, IDM, and techno that makes that era of music and Spacetime Continuum (née Jonah Sharp) special to me.

            WOOB - STRANGE AIR

            From WOOB 1194 [EM:T, 1994]
          </h3>
          <p>
            I have owned 3 copies of this album, which I learned about in my late teens, but didn't get for at least ten years, given that it's moderately rare. Eventually I got it on discogs and very soon after found it at Sonic Boom for like $9 - I got that copy and loaned it to my brother. I then found another copy, laid out among a few hundred CDs a neighbour put out on the lawn in front of their building - I got about 50 CDs that day, which remains one of the great CD hauls of my life, and it was across the street from my apartment, unadvertised and free. While the more chant-heavy world-beat tracks are a little corny, I think this album is a masterpiece. It goes so many places, in so many ways, vastly surpassing all the new age schlock it stands next to. More than the namesake compilation, this album is Pure Moods.

            This song is incredible, though for the full effect, it's best to listen to the album, where it starts after a long abstract passage that culminates in a sample (presumably from a old movie) of a shriek and gunshot. The effect is startling, and so doesn't fit in this mix, but the shock melts into catharsis and amplifies the effect of the pads. To me, this song is like a sonic representation of passing through darkness, allowing oneself to stay with fear until it settles and dissipates, allowing one to keep moving until light and levity come through from within the darkness itself. I also love the title, Strange Air, which (like "Jump Source") doesn't signify anything I can think of, but makes sense on an affective level. It's long been a favourite mix-closer for me.
