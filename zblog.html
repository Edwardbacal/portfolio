  <p>
    I’ve become interested in what I’m tentatively calling “ersatz sculpture”: public structures that are neither art nor architecture, nor even landscape or monument, but forms that share characteristics of art-qua-art. These are structures that are not engaged with, or by, art discourse, but merit attention from an art historical perspective, given the ways they converge with particular aesthetic strategies. As someone with a specific focus on minimal and post-minimal art, I often see a substantial overlap between sculpture and these unremarkable structures, between art objects and <em>just</em> objects. I’m interested in exploring this Venn diagram of, on one side, art that blends into public space or the surrounding landscape and, on the other, the forms and structures that resemble them 
</p>

<p>
  While works of art and architecture are routinely read through their (deliberate, superficial, accidental) resemblance to “real world” things, the opposite is less common.  It can be hard to make a case for close readings of what is indifferent to the methods of displaying and categorizing art object, while still relying on that methodological vocabulary. This often means shoring up art/non-art distinctions that, in my opinion, make for very uninteresting thinking, not to mention questionable frameworks for understanding the aesthetic. Moreover, this approach often risks falling into irony, becoming a gimmicky exercise in treating ordinary items in specialized art terms. With those concerns in mind, I want to consider these “ordinary” structures because, simply, aesthetic decisions matter, even outside the institutional and discursive environments that distinguish them as valuable. Additionally, there is the fact that an artwork can look like anything, so it begs the question to say that something resembles art. As such, I intend to focus on key criteria to draw meaningful comparisons between things that are created, defined, presented, and treated as art and things that aren’t. I am specifically interested in the following:
</p>

<p>
 My sense is that these pieces comprise an exhibition of artifacts from a time that has recently become “old” in new ways. The exhibition feels very much like a time capsule, capturing the styles, conflicts, and technologies of the mid-70s, along with the new possibilities for creative production TVTV was exploring. As much as this exhibition is about the practical novelties of the Portapak camera and the visual rhetoric of broadcasting in the McLuhan age, it portrays a horizontally-organized collective working against dominant institutions. This was a time when the dematerialization of the art object and the exploration of non-traditional media coincided with new methods of production, eschewing authorial individuality in favour of collectivity and collaboration. Many of these groups have been subsumed back into art history (for instance, I think of recent interest in Food, the restaurant/gallery/studio associated with Gordon Matta-Clark), so it makes sense to see this exhibition today, within a gallery setting. The exhibition feels timely, then, in that the work outlines cultural tendencies that run through the present, but we can see more clearly with the benefit of historical oversight. 
</p>

<p>
  i) Works of abstract sculpture that, in using materials and forms that are shared in industrial production and civic infrastructure, appear “unremarkable.”
</p>
<p>
  ii) Non-art structures and forms that play a functional role in public space, whether symbolic or practical. These are not defined as works of art, in the loose sense of serving aesthetic contemplation, institutional recognition, or analysis in terms typically reserved for artworks, including public sculptures, installations, monuments, and works of architecture.
</p>
<p>
  iii) Structures and forms whose production, display, or effects overlap with deliberate artist strategies, often to different ends. I am especially interested in how  “good” artistic strategies (formally or conceptually innovative techniques that correspond to critical aesthetic or social positions) can be “bad” (socially repressive or regressive) in non-art contexts. 
</p>
<p>
  iv) Instances of what might count as art, architecture, or the like, but is for certain contextual reasons displaced from those categories. 
</p>

<p>
  In looking at examples of these criteria, I believe we can not only understand and illuminate instances of “ersatz sculpture,” we can also learn a lot about art history through an expanded look at its aesthetic manifestations.
</p>

<p>
  I have three main examples I plan to write
</p>

<p>
1. A decommissioned flagpole outside the Haus Der Kunst in Munich, which resembles Brian Jungen’s Upside Down Flagpole outside the Polygon museum in Vancouver.
<br>
2. A set of concrete barriers temporarily installed in front of then-illegal Cannabis shop Cafe, which corresponds to a  works in the history of minimal art that, by accident or design, block entrances.
<br>
3. The infamous gender-reveal bomb that, in caused the 2019 wildfire in California, which echoes Judy Chicago's smoke bomb works from the 1970s, that intended to interrupt the masculinist gendering of land art.
