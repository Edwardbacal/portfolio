<h4><em>Plastic Heart: Surface All the Way Through</em>September 8, 2021–November 20, 2021</h4>

<p>
  <em>Plastic Heart</em>, on view at UTAC, is an extensive group show addressing the environmental and social crises related to plastic production and waste. As a gallery show, it also aims to illustrate the ecological problems with conventional exhibition formats while demonstrating less resource intensive approaches to displaying art. The result is “an experimental exhibition that examines plastic as art material, cultural object, geologic process, petrochemical product, and a synthetic substance fully entangled with the human body.” In other words, the exhibition surveys the manifold practical and symbolic application of plastics, charting the material’s inextricability with our experience of simply living in this world. <em>Plastic Heart</em> is therefore broad in scope, matching the mandate of its organizer, <a href=“https://syntheticcollective.org/“>The Synthetic Collective</a>, “an interdisciplinary collaboration between visual artists, cultural workers and scientists [… that] sample, map, understand, and visualize the complexities of plastics and micro-plastics pollution in the Great Lakes Region.”

This retrospective comes fifteen years after the AGO’s last Warhol show, “Supernova: Stars, Deaths and Disasters,” which I remember as a standard-fare survey that distinguished itself only through the gimmick of featuring David Cronenberg as curator. Time has come again for another standard-fare survey, simply titled “Andy Warhol”, without a nominal theme or curatorial gimmick. It's a textbook retrospective that follows the artist’s oeuvre along chronological and biographical lines; however, two qualities stand out. 1) the exhibition focuses on a notably wide range of media and practices, giving more attention to "minor" works than I expected: I’m thinking of his early drawings, stitched photographs, TV appearances, and drag queens portraits. I appreciated this variety. 2) The exhibition emphasizes Warhol’s queerness and working class, immigrant background throughout. While the artist’s campy sexuality is unavoidable anywhere, this exhibition doesn’t feel like it’s tip-toeing around it, relative to a long history of museums sanitizing queerness.

<p>
 In these ways, the exhibition doesn’t say anything new about Warhol, but speaks to what’s changed since “Supernova” (a lot has changed since 2006, by the way). In a post <em>Drag-Race</em>, post </em><a href="https://npg.si.edu/exhibition/hideseek-difference-and-desire-american-portraiture">Hide/Seek</a></em> world, there's considerably more interest in sexual and gender diversity at a public-ish level, and more pressure on cultural institutions to not just reiterate the normativity of the Western canon. This makes for greater interest in, say, Warhol’s early homoerotic drawings and more obscure works like his drag queen portraits. Perhaps we're at a point where Marsha P Johnson now attracts comparable interest to Warhol's classic subjects? It's great the AGO is highlighting this material and engaging with current discourse around sex, race, and gender, however, the way it frames Warhol’s marginality/proximity to the marginal points to some contradictions. I feel like the exhibition  elaborates Warhol’s working-class upbringing (nevermind his later wealth and enormous social capital) and queerness as a way of deflecting the fact this is ultimately <em>another</em> hagiographic retrospective of a <em>Great Artist</em>, arguably the most represented modern artist next to Picasso (naturally, the AGO is following this show with a Picasso one). At times it feels like the exhibtion positions Warhol as vaguely non-establishment, despite his larger-than-life status within the art market, museum industry, and popular culture. It's true that Warhol always had one foot on the outside, and the exhibition documents the influence of his eccentric coterie while addressing the problems of, say, selling portraits of unknown Black drag queens. That said, I’m not sure if the AGO is leveraging Warhol’s status to bring those eccentricities to the fore, or leveraging those eccentricities to validate the exhibition's relevance. Is it trying to adjust the popular perspective on Warhol, away from giftshop posters with decontextualized quotes and toward his complex social reality? Or is it giving mass-culture Warhol a superficial coat of 2020s social criticism while reiterating the art historical status quo?

<h4><em>Riopelle: The Call of Northern Landscapes and Indigenous Cultures</em> at the MBA, Montreal, 11/25/2020 – 09/12/2021</h4>

<p>
  My experience of seeing art in Montreal has been synonymous with Jean-Paul Riopelle and his body of distinct abstract paintings. Riopelle’s innovative abstract work has made him an eminent symbol of cultural modernity in Canada and, especially, Quebec. As such, his work is unavoidable at venues like the Musée Des Beaux Arts, which dedicated a solo retrospective to him this past summer. More than a standard-fare survey, this exhibition shifts away from the usual narratives of Riopelle’s career, which focus on his participation in the Quebec avant-garde and work in France, located among hermetic, urban communities of artists and writers. Instead, the exhibition considers Riopelle’s experience in Canada’s Northern Territories and his interest in the region’s landscape and Indigenous cultures. This curatorial focus does two significant things: it highlights a different narrative of Riopelle’s career and it incorporates the influence of Indigenous cultures in the lands he worked on. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
  By framing the exhibition around the Indigenous influence on the artist’s oeuvre—and by proxy, Canadian art history—the MABM follows longstanding shifts in attitude and practice around the inclusion and curation of Indigenous content in Canadian art. Cultural institutions in Canada have worked to keep pace with broad social concern for Indigenous sovereignty and culture, and this exhibition is an example of how they have made tangible steps forward while also, however, making avoidable missteps. This exhibition does its part to acknowledge the contribution of Indigenous creators in terms other than derivative, inferior, or exotic. Moreover, it addresses the history of European avant-gardes fetishizing Indigenous cultures, and how those Eurocentric perspectives have shaped art history throughout the twentieth century. However, the exhibition is still very much tethered to grand narratives of <em>Great White Artists</em> who are already ubiquitous in Canadian art history. In other words, it presents difference only as it pertains to the same.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  Depending on your sympathies, this curatorial approach may read as an honest effort to recognize Indigenous communities in Canadian art history or a cynical bid to demonstrate concern for Indigeneity while reaffirming a Eurocentric canon. Tacking on Indigenous content to yet <em>more</em> Riopelle content feels like an uninspired response to calls for better inclusion. It may be unfair to position this exhibition as a conscious response to such calls, when the museum could have easily done nothing. Even still, the exhibition lands in the difficult middle space of well intentioned doing-something and a more malign not-doing-enough-of-something. In that regard, it feels like an underwhelming measure to protect the relevance of canonical work. Like with the AGO’s Warhol exhibition, it points to underrepresented cultures while continuing to commit solo shows to arguably overrepresented artists.

<p>
  To the MBAM's credit, the exhibition also includes several pieces by contemporary Indigenous artists, along with various historical examples of the art and craft that influenced Riopelle. To highlight one new piece I appreciated, Duane Linklater's <em>A Gift from Doreen</em> features a large, undecorated canvas hanging from the wall and gently draping onto the floor. This "blank canvas" bears the natural marks and colourations it absorbed over its life as a teepee cover, including the imprint of the teepee's frame, smoke from fires made inside it, and the effects of weather. Linklater's neighbour gifted him the canvas after her teepee was damaged by a storm, and as such it presents a real index of lived experience on Nippising First Nation. Moreover, the canvas indexes a relation whereby its end as a functional object dovetails with the act of giving; it becomes a document of generosity among neighbours that, Linklater states, "points at an 'uninterefered' exchange among Indigenous people...." 
</p>

<p>
  I'm a stan for anything that imbues Minimalist aesthetics with the material indices of concrete social experiences, and this work is a great example. It uses a minimum of visual mediation to draw out its material qualities, emphasizing the canvas as the work's formal substance and its centre of meaning. While the canvas is imposing in its scale it is disarming in the way it softly folds onto the floor, as if to say, this is not the taut surface of a stretched painting hung parallel to the wall. Lapping onto the floor and into the viewer's space, the canvas presents itself as material from the world, used, exchanged, and now displayed for visitors to contemplate. Here, canvas is not a ground on which to represent meaning, rather, it contains its own meaning in the abstract marks of its specificity—to its environment, to its users, and to the kind of ethics of uninterfered exchange Linklater describes. As a supplement to the Riopelle exhibition, it offers a rich elboaration on what abstraction (and arguably, painting) can do in a contemporary, socially and culturally aware, contexts.
