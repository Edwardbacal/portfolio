The Art Gallery of Ontario and Musée des Beaux Arts, Montreal
</p>
 
<p>
I'm rarely excited by exhibitions at the Art Gallery of Ontario or the Musée des Beaux Arts, Montreal, museums that regularly play it safe in their big-ticket shows (I know it’s not entirely fair to blame my indifference on public institutions that presumably lack the financial security and audience base to make more adventurous programming viable, a difficult situation the pandemic can only have exacerbated). I’m grateful to visit these museums again, but it’s still disappointing to find them operating on the classic rock radio station model: playing a recurring cycle of known hits to patrons seeking familiarityz. In dedicating space to household names like Andy Warhol and (in Quebec) Jean Paul Riopelle, I wonder what these museums achieve relative to changing attitudes about the diversity of cultural programming.

<h4><em>Andy Warhol</em> at the AGO</h4>

<p>
This exhibition comes fifteen years after the AGO’s last Warhol show, “Supernova: Stars, Deaths and Disasters,” which I remember as a standard-fare survey that distinguished itself only through the gimmick of featuring David Cronenberg as curator. Time has come again for another standard-fare survey, simply titled “Andy Warhol”, which follows the artist’s oeuvre along chronological and biographical lines. This time around two qualities stood out: 1) the exhibition focuses on a notably wide range of media and practices, giving more attention to "minor" works than I expected—I’m thinking of his early drawings, stitched photographs, TV appearances, and drag queens portraits. I appreciated this variety. 2) The exhibition emphasizes Warhol’s queerness and working class, immigrant background throughout. While the artist’s campy gayness is unavoidable anywhere, this exhibition doesn’t feel like it’s tip-toeing around it, relative to a long history of museums sanitizing queerness.
</p>

<p>
 In these ways, the exhibition doesn’t really say anything new about Warhol, but speaks to what’s changed since “Supernova” (a lot has changed since 2006, by the way). In a post <em>Drag-Race</em>, post </em>Hide and Seek</em> world, there's considerably more interest in sexual and gender diversity at a public-ish level, and more pressure on cultural institutions to not just reiterate the normativity of the Western canon. This makes for greater interest in, say, Warhol’s early homoerotic drawings and more obscure works like his drag queen portraits. We're at a point, perhaps, where Marsha P Johnson attracts comparable interest to Warhol's classic subjects, or maybe new audiences are less encahnted by the celebrity and spectacle that "Supernova" focused on?

<p>
I'm for highlighting this material and engaging with current discourse around sex, race, and gender; however, the AGO's emphasis on Warhol’s marginality/proximity to the marginal points to some contradictions. 
I feel like the AGO is leveraging Warhol’s working-class upbringing (nevermind his later wealth and social capital) and his queerness as a way of deflecting the fact this is ultimately <em>another</em> solo retrospective of a <em>Great Artist</em>, arguably the most represented modern artist next to Picasso (naturally, the AGO is following this show with a Picasso one). At times it feels like the AGO is positioning Warhol as vaguely non-establishment, despite his larger-than-life status within the art market, museum industry, and popular culture. It's true that Warhol always had one foot on the outside, and the exhibition documents the influence of his eccentric coterie while addressing the complexities of, say, selling portraits of unknown Black drag queens. That said, I’m not sure if the AGO is leveraging Warhol’s status to bring those eccentricities to the fore, or leveraging those eccentricities to validate the exhibition's relevance. Is it trying to adjust the popular perspective on Warhol, away from giftshop posters with decontextualized quotes and toward his complex social reality? Or is it giving mass-culture Warhol a superficial coat of 2020s social criticism?

<h4><em>Riopelle: The Call of Northern Landscapes and Indigenous Cultures</em> at the MBA, Montreal, 11/25/2020 – 09/12/2021</h4>

<p>
The last ten years have seen remarkable shifts around the inclusion and curation of Indigenous content in Canadian art discourse. Cultural institutions in Canada have worked to keep pace with broad social concern for Indigenous sovereignty and culture. This exhibition is an example of how such institutions have made tangible steps forward while also making avoidable missteps. 
</p>

<p>
The MBA’s latest Riopelle retrospective, is largely built around the influence of Indigenous cultures, peoples, and territories on the artist’s oeuvre—and by proxy, Canadian art history. This exhibition does its part to acknowledge the contribution of Indigenous creators in terms other than derivative, inferior, or exotic; however, it remains tethered to an individual white artist (and so, grand narratives of <em>great artists</em>) who is already ubiquitous in Canadian art history. In other words, it presents difference only as it pertains to the same.
</p>

<p>
Depending on your sympathies, this curatorial approach may read as an honest effort to recognize Indigenous communities in Canadian art history or, on the other hand, a cynical bid to demonstrate concern for Indigeneity while reaffirming a Eurocentric canon. Tacking on Indigenous content to yet <em>more</em> Riopelle content feels like an uninspired response to calls for better inclusion. It may be unfair to position this exhibition as a conscious response to such calls, when the museum could have easily done nothing. Even still, the exhibition lands in the difficult middle space of well intentioned doing-something and a more malign not-doing-enough-of-something. In that regard, it feels like an underwhelming half measure to make overrepresented work relevant.
